## Features  
- **Two-Player Mode**: Play chess with a friend on the same device.  
- **Chess Bot**: An AI opponent built using the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning, providing an optimal challenge for players.  
- **Interactive GUI**: Designed using Pygame for a seamless user experience.  
- **Rule Enforcement**: Ensures valid moves and handles game-ending scenarios like checkmate and stalemate.

## Installation:

### Prerequisites:  
- Python 3.x  
- Pygame library  

### Steps to Run:  
**1. Clone this repository:**  
   
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chess-game.git


**2. Navigate to the project directory:**

cd chess-game


**3. Install Pygame:**

pip install pygame


**4. Run the main script:**

python main.py


## Methodology:


**The project was developed following these steps:**

**Setting Up the Chess Board:** Designed a graphical board using Pygame.

**Implementing Game Logic:** Enforced chess rules for piece movements and game states.

**Adding AI:** Integrated the chess bot using the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning for optimal move decisions.

**Creating the User Interface:** Built an intuitive GUI using Pygame for player interactions.

**Testing and Debugging:** Ensured a smooth gameplay experience by thoroughly testing the code.
Languages and Tools

**Python 3:** Core programming language used for logic and computation.

**Pygame:** Library for creating the graphical user interface and handling user interactions.
